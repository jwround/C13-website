<h3>Palm-oil in the beauty industry</h3>



70% of all beauty products contain palm-oil, and every year, the industry consumes more then 1.5 million tonnes. This requires half a million hectares of rainforest be used as palm plantations, which carries a devastating environmental and social toll. And this problem is not going away, palm-oil consumption keeps growing. Our planet need solutions, and we think we can help.
