<h3>Palm oil in the beauty industry</h3>



70% of all beauty products contain palm oil. Every year, the cosmetic industry consumes more than 1.5 million tonnes of palm oil, which requires that half a million hectares of rainforest be used as palm plantations. This carries a devastating environmental and social toll. And this problem is not going away - palm oil consumption keeps growing. Our planet needs solutions, and we can help.
